			<h2>A Tribute to Pedro Almodóvar</h2>

				Almodóvar's career is a bounty of riches, and any ranking of his work means something will surely be left out. But here, ahead of the opening of "The Human Voice," the director's finest film in years, take a look back at his best movies.

            Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988)
        	</dt>
            <dd>
            Pedro Almodóvar’s hilarious and insane 1988 film “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” is the culmination and anticipation of all of the director’s favorite fetishes. In fact, “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” might as well be the title of his entire filmography. It’s also one of the most cathartic breakup movies ever. Pepa (Carmen Maura) is a television actress who comes hysterically unglued after her boyfriend dumps her out of the blue. From a bed set aflame by cigarettes to gazpacho spiked with sleeping pills, this film is packed with outrageous images, and it sets the stage for Almodóvar’s ensuing, and endless, obsession with damaged women.

        		Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990)
        	</dt>
        	<dd>“Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!” is the most darkly funny of Almodóvar’s early punk efforts as a queer director bursting onto the scene. Most of the film is a quirky two-hander between Banderas and Abril — until it spirals into something else entirely, and something deeply sad.</dd>
        	<dt>
        		All About My Mother (1999)
        	</dt>
        	<dd>
        		Almodóvar rightly won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 1999 for this luscious ode to the women and the films that have inspired him. The film is, in fact, as a title card explains, dedicated “to Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, Romy Schneider…To all actresses who have played actresses, to all women who act, to men who act and become women, to all people who want to become mothers. To my mother.”<br/>

				“All About My Mother” is Almodóvar nerding out over the great women of cinema, with one of the film’s chief turning points being a recreation of a scene from John Cassavetes’ backstage drama “Opening Night,” starring Gena Rowlands.

        		Volver (2006)
        	</dt>
        	<dd>
        		The 21st-century stretch of Almodóvar’s career has found the director working at the peak of his powers, and 2006’s “Volver” is no exception. Penélope Cruz burns through the screen as Raimunda, a lower-middle-class housewife tasked with covering up her husband’s murder, and communicating with the (maybe) ghost of her mother who died (or did she?) in a fire. The film is generously stuffed with a rich cast of characters — from Blanca Portillo’s pot-smoking Agustina to Carmen Maura’s paranoid Irene — and bursts with mouthwatering primary colors thanks to cinematographer José Luis Alcaine.

        		Broken Embraces (2009)
        	</dt>
        	<dd>
        		Penélope Cruz scorches in this 2009 Almodóvar melodrama that collages all of the director’s key fascinations. Alberto Iglesias’ Bernard Herrmann-esque score is quite possibly his best, undercutting the flamboyant drama onscreen (and, for the record, every Iglesias score is iconic music). As with this year’s “Pain and Glory,” past and present come into collision in “Broken Embraces,” as a blind screenwriter played by Lluís Homar recalls his burned love affair with a dead actress, played by Cruz.
